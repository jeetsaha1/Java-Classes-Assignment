# 📘 Java Assignment: Inheritance (Basic to Advanced)

## 📌 Project Title
**Implementation of Inheritance in Java – From Basic to Advanced Concepts**

---

## 📖 Introduction
Inheritance is a fundamental concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java. It allows one class (subclass) to inherit the properties and methods of another class (superclass). This assignment demonstrates inheritance in Java starting from basic concepts and progressing to advanced implementations.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the concept of inheritance in Java  
- Implement different types of inheritance  
- Demonstrate method overriding and code reusability  
- Learn the usage of the `super` keyword  
- Apply inheritance in real-world programming examples  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Programming Language: **Java**
- JDK Version: **JDK 8 or above**
- IDE (Optional): Eclipse / IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code

## 🧩 Concepts Covered

### 1. Basic Inheritance
- Introduction to classes and objects  
- Use of the `extends` keyword  

### 2. Single Inheritance
- One subclass inherits from one superclass  

### 3. Multilevel Inheritance
- A class derived from another derived class  
- Example: `Class A → Class B → Class C`  

### 4. Hierarchical Inheritance
- Multiple subclasses inherit from a single superclass  

### 5. Method Overriding
- Redefining parent class methods in child class  
- Use of `@Override` annotation  

### 6. Super Keyword
- Accessing superclass variables and methods  
- Calling superclass constructors  

### 7. Runtime Polymorphism (Advanced)
- Method overriding using dynamic method dispatch  
- Parent class reference referring to child class object
